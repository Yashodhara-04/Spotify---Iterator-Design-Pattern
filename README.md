# Spotify

A simple Spotify implemented in Java using the Iterator Design Pattern to provide undo/redo functionality and handle text editing operations.

## Overview

This project implements a basic music app that supports InOrder, Reverse, and Shuffle playback modes, utilizing the Iterator design pattern.

## Iterator Pattern

Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

## Features

- In Order Iterator : Iterators in a ascending order.
- Reverse Iterator : Iterators in a descending order.
- Shuffled Iterator : Iterators in a random order.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yashodhara-04/Spotify.git
    ```

2. Compile the Java files:

    ```bash

    ```

3. Run the `Main` class:
